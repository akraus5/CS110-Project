    "start" : "Welcome traveller. Your mission is about to begin. You are headed to the Far Colony, the furthest human outreach post from Earth, to help the colony advance their transgalactic Warp Drive capabilities. The Far Colony is located far beyond the edge of our solar system. You do not have enough food or supplies to make it there in one shot. Lucky for you, there are several resupply locations on the route. Your ship launches tomorrow. Do you accept [C] or deny [Q] the mission?",
    "lev1" : "You are exhausted from your journey, but some of your friends are throwing a party. Do you go to the party, or stay in for the night? Press 1 to go to party, press 2 to head to sleep. Q to quit",
    "lev2" : "You have finally made it to the Curiosity Center of Mars. You are ready to start resupplying your ship with fuel, food, and water, when a message is displayed on your ship's dashboard. The message reads 'Warning: Water may contain R. horus, a bacterial species of Mars origin. Without proper filtration, the water may be toxic. Select a filtration method: activated carbon [1] or coagulation [2]’                                 Which will you choose?",
    "lev3" : "The POD is the first checkpoint satellite in our solar system. All ships are required to dock to the POD and get approval before passing Jupiter. However, when you told the POD authorities that you are being sent on a mission to the Far Colony, they laughed and said that there are no outreach posts beyond the POD. You knew that the Far Colony was a top secret research base, but you did not know that even the POD authorities were not aware of its existence. You can either try contacting your boss back on Earth for assistance, but through unencrypted channels [1], or leave the POD and risk continuing past Jupiter without detection [2].",
    "fin" : "You finally made it to the Far Colony. You are one of the only people to travel this far from Earth. You are close to getting a working Warp Drive, but need another researcher to help with your final calculations. Unfortunately, none of the current Far Colony researchers have the knowledge to complete these calculations. You tell your boss to find another Warp Drive expert back on Earth, and have them join you in the Far Colony. You set your spaceship to autopilot and send it back to Earth. It’s only a matter of time until we figure out Warp Drive technology. Press c to continue or q to quit."
